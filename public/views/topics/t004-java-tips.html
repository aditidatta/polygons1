<h1>Java Tips and Tricks</h1>

<h2>1) Arrays.asList(T... a) like method for primitive type arrays </h2>
<p>
    Arrays.asList(T... a) creates a <code>List</code> which is just a wrapper around a regular array <code>a[]</code>. That array then can be used as a list with different methods in java collections. Here, no iteration or copies are performed. Hence, the time complexity is <code>O(1)</code>. But it doesn't work with the primitive
    type arrays. If an <code>int[]</code> is passed, it will just create a <code>List&ltint[]&gt</code> object, i.e. the whole array as an element in the list. So, what can we do to acheive the same with primitive type arrays? Here's what we can do:
</p>
<code data-gist-id="8024d58004072c349c730c9d2ce0ecf3" gist-enable-cache="true"></code>
<p>
    Now, there's another way to do it, that is by creating stream (we will discuss about streams soon) of the array:
</p>
<code data-gist-id="1edb7b85ae084cb3979f9614e6a2a223" gist-enable-cache="true"></code>
<p>
    But there's a difference between these two methods. The 1st one just creates a wrapper, so there's no copy. But in the 2nd method there's a copy operation going on underneath. You can test it by modifying <code>a[]</code>. You will see that <code>list</code> object from the 2nd method will stay unchanged. That's because <code>IntStream.boxed()</code> actually wraps the primitive data into their object classes (like from <code>int</code> to <code>Integer</code>) and that actually creates new copies of the data.
    Hence, the time complexity of the 2nd method is <code>O(N)</code>, whereas the time complexity of the 1st method is <code>O(1)</code>. But note that it needs different implementations for different types.

<h2>3) LinkedList vs ArrayList</h2>
<p>
	<code data-gist-id="7336bf21bece4c65126950e81332cac5" gist-enable-cache="true"></code>
</p>
<h2>4) String pool</h2>
<p>
	<code data-gist-id="3a92eee29be332b83adeca0d5d408896" gist-enable-cache="true"></code>
</p>
<h2>5) Use lambdas</h2>
<p></p>
<h2>6) Use Iterators when modifying the data structure</h2>
<p></p>
<h2>7) Use Collections framework</h2>
<p></p>
<h2>8) Use in-built <code>binarySearch()</code> & <code>sort()</code></h2>
<p></p>
<h2>10) JNI for fast mathematical operations</h2>
